# VISITORS-PLEASE-READ

These projects are the work of a student and while most score full marks during grading, not all did therefore use the code at your
own risk.

Since this public, be sure to cite where you obtained the code else you risk academic dishonesty to use the code without citation.  You
are responsible for proper citation.

If you have any questions regarding code found here, feel free to email me at edgbpc@mail.umsl.edu and I'll be happy to try to answer.

Take Care,
Eric~!
